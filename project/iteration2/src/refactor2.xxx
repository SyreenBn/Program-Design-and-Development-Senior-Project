// -----------------------------change the name of the Obstacle vector----------
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The first variable in the arena.cc class.
- The old name is (res) and the new one is (obstcls)
- The old vector name is res. This variable is named in the base class. When
  I was working on iteration 3 I decide to make the declaration of the vector
  in arena.h to make the function more simpler. After three days of this changing,
  I forgot that I move the declaration of the vector to the arena.h class and
  I did not know what this vector use to because the name of the vector is not
  refer to the obstacles. So, for that reason, I decided to change this name in
  refactor2.

// -----------------------------change the name of the loseGame variable--------
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The first variable in the arena.cc, player.h, player.cc and
  graphicsArenaViewer.cc class.
- The old name of the variable is loseGame and the new one is endGame.
- This variable is use to print the sentence of end the game, either winning
  or losing the game. When the player won the game loseGame be "WOW, YOU
  WON THE GAME" which is does not make sense and if another programmer read
  the code, he/she could be confused. So, I change the function and the variable.
